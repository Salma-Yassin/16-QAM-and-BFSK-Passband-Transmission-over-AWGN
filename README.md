## 16-QAM-and-BFSK-Passband-Transmission-over-AWGN

This repo contains implementation for BFSK and 16-QAM Modulation schemes for digital signals. It has functions for generating a random stream of 0's and 1's (message), and modulation. It shows the constellations of the transmitted signal before and after passing through an AWGN channel. Also, it uses the ML (maximum likelihood) rule to decode the symbols at the receiver side.
